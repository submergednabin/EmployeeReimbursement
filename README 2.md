# Employee Reimbursment System (ERS)

## Executive Summary
The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

## Technical Requirements

The back-end system shall use JDBC to connect to a Postgres database. The middle tier shall use Javalin technology for dynamic Web application development. The front-end view shall use HTML/CSS/JavaScript to make an application that can call server-side components in a generally RESTful manner. The middle tier shall follow proper layered architecture, have reasonable (~70%) test coverage of the service layer. Webpages shall be styled to be functional and readable. 

**Stretch Goals (if you'd like to use this technology):**
* Replace JDBC with Hibernate to manage the database connection.
* Users can upload a document or image of their receipt when submitting reimbursements which can stored in the database and reviewed by a financial manager.
* Postgres Database shall be hosted remotely on GCP Cloud SQL. 
* User shall implement log4j2 to log relevant data to a logs transcript
